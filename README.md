# Titanic_Kaggle

Trying out two ways:
Sklearn library algorithms (Random Forest and Decision Trees) and Neural Network.

The best result for neural network - 79,4%. 
Architecture: 
 - Input (891, 16); 
 - Hidden layer with 6 neurons (6,16);
 - Activation functions: ReLU-->Sigmoid
 - Optimization: gradient descent
